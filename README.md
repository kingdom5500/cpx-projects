# Adafruit CPX Projects
This is just a little repository of various CircuitPython projects I've done with my [CPX (Circuit Playground Express)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333). Each project will have its own folder which may contain a README explaining how to set it up and use it. Some of these may also have additional Python scripts that should run on the computer (rather than the CPX). Any dependencies and requirements for these scripts will be listed on the README. Unless otherwise specified, the CPX code for each project will be saved in `code.py`.

### Contributing
I plan to have just my own projects here, but some contributions will be appreciated. For example, as of writing, some of these projects use serial connections between the CPX and the computer, but the ports for these are platform-dependent. I'll be happy to accept any pull requests that open these projects up to more platforms, as I can't do that myself. :)
